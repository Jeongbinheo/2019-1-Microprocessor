# Microprocessor
> ## Introduction
> The codes of Lecture of Microprocessor are saved in this repository.
After Understanding the operation of Microcontroller CPU,  I made mini CPU(we called it tPU) by C++ codes in Lecture of Microprocessor which is proceeded by Prof. D.J.Park 
Now I'll go on a explaination each code a little bit in detail. 

> ## tPU
> 
> tPU is the abbreviation of Tiny Process Unit. It is composed of 3 Units as  CDecode, CExecute, and CRegsiter. Also, To explain all the processes of tPU, we should add CMemory and CCode.
